## Docker

Docker is a popular platform used for containerization. It allows developers to package their applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, isolated, and portable, making it easier to deploy and run applications consistently across different environments.

Here are some key reasons why Docker is widely used:

- **Portability**: Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and system tools. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production. Developers can build and test applications locally and then deploy them to any environment without worrying about compatibility issues.

- **Isolation**: Docker containers provide a high level of isolation, allowing applications to run independently without interfering with each other. Each container has its own file system, network interfaces, and process space, ensuring that changes made within a container do not affect other containers or the host system. This isolation improves security and stability.

- **Efficiency**: Docker uses a layered file system and image caching, which enables efficient resource utilization. Docker images are built using layers, and if multiple images share the same layers, they are reused, reducing the storage space required. Additionally, containers start quickly because they only need to run the processes defined in the image, rather than booting up an entire operating system.

- **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple containers of the same image across different hosts or in a cluster. This allows applications to handle increased traffic and workload by distributing the load across multiple containers.

- **Collaboration**: Docker simplifies collaboration among developers and teams. Docker images can be shared and distributed through container registries, allowing developers to easily share their applications and collaborate on projects. This promotes consistency and reproducibility across different development environments.

## Docker Engine

Docker Engine is the runtime that runs and manages containers created with Docker. It's the underlying client-server technology that builds and runs containers. Docker Engine includes the Docker CLI command line interface, and the API which can be used to interact with the Docker daemon.

Docker Engine has three components:

- **Server**: The Docker daemon, called dockerd, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects.

- **REST API**: The Docker daemon exposes a REST API for programs to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The Docker CLI, docker, is a command line interface that interacts with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Most of the Docker CLI commands are for creating, managing and removing Docker containers and images.

Docker Engine supports different storage drivers, network interfaces, and plugins, allowing it to be used with a wide variety of operating systems and cloud providers. It's also responsible for Docker's security features like container isolation.

## Docker objects

Docker has several objects that are used to build, ship, and run applications. Here are the main ones:

- **Images**: Docker images are read-only templates that contain a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. They are created from a set of layers that are built upon each other to produce a final image.

- **Containers**: A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. Each container is isolated from other containers and its host machine.

- **Services**: In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services”. For example, if you have a video-sharing site, it probably includes a service for storing application data in a database, a service for video transcoding in the background after a user uploads something, a service for the front-end, and so on. Services are really just “containers in production.”

- **Volumes**: Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

- **Networks**: Docker’s networking subsystem is pluggable, using drivers. Several networks drivers exist out of the box, and provide core networking functionality.

- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. Dockerfiles are a set of instructions that Docker uses to build an image automatically.

- **Docker** Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services.

## Container

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Containers are designed to be portable and consistent across environments. They isolate the software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development

## Image/Container

```
docker images
docker pull ubuntu
docker run -it -d --name mycontainer1 -p 80:80 ubuntu
docker exec -ti mycontainer1 bash
apt install nginx -y
service nginx status | service nginx start | service nginx restart | service nginx stop
docker stop 0e0bfe32b9e0
docker kill 0e0bfe32b9e0
docker restart 0e0bfe32b9e0
docker rm bb10a05dafcc
docker rm -f bb10a05dafcc
docker commit 6a8267b3e542 ubuntu-nginx
docker ps | findstr con
docker logs aacfdd040f92
docker logs aacfdd040f92 --tail 10
docker logs aacfdd040f92 --tail 10 -f
docker logs aacfdd040f92 | findstr "error"
```

## Docker Volums

In Docker, volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow you to share data between a host system and Docker containers, as well as between different containers.

Here are some key points about Docker volumes:

**Data Persistence**: Volumes are used to persist data even if the container is stopped or removed. This is essential for applications that generate or rely on data that should persist beyond the lifespan of a container.

```
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myimage
```

**Mounting Volumes**: You can mount a volume into a Docker container by specifying it in the docker run command with the -v or --volume option. For example:

```
docker volume create myvolume
docker run -v myvolume:/container/path myimage
```

**Named Volumes**: Docker also supports named volumes, which are managed by Docker and can be more convenient to use. You can create a named volume with the docker volume create command, and then reference it in your docker run command:

```
docker volume create myvolume
docker run -v myvolume:/container/path myimage
```

**Docker Compose**: If you are using Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications, you can specify volumes in your docker-compose.yml file:

```
version: '3'
services:
  myservice:
    image: myimage
    volumes:
      - /host/path:/container/path

```

docker tag ubuntu-nginx sushant968/ubuntu-nginx-image

20. **WORKDIR (multiple):**
    - **Purpose:** Allows you to change the working directory multiple times in a single Dockerfile.
    - **Syntax:** `WORKDIR /path/to/directory`

## Docker Storage

#### The data doesn't persist when that container no longer exists, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.

#### A container's writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You can't easily move the data somewhere else.

#### Writing into a container's writable layer requires a storage driver to manage the filesystem. The storage driver provides a union filesystem, using the Linux kernel. This extra abstraction reduces performance as compared to using data volumes, which write directly to the host filesystem.

## Docker Storage

**Volumes**
**Bind Mount**
**Tmpfs mount**

**Volumes:**
Docker volumes are a way to persist and manage data outside the lifecycle of a container. Volumes are separate from the container filesystem and can be used to share data between containers or persist data even if the container is removed.

**Bind Mount:**
Bind mounts allow you to mount a directory from the host machine into a container. This means that changes made in the container or on the host are reflected in both places.

**Tmpfs Mount:**
Docker allows you to mount a tmpfs (temporary filesystem) into a container. Tmpfs is a memory-backed filesystem that does not persist data. It is useful for scenarios where temporary data needs to be stored in memory rather than on disk.

### Volumes

```
docker voulme create dibyastore
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect dibyastore
docker volume rm dibyastore
docker volume prune
docker voulme create dibyastoreRO //Read only
```

```
{
        "CreatedAt": "2023-11-19T04:33:30Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/dibyastore/_data",
        "Name": "dibyastore",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
```

**CreatedAt:** Indicates the timestamp when the volume was created. In this case, it was created on November 19, 2023, at 04:33:30 UTC.

**Driver:** Specifies the storage driver used for this volume. In this case, the driver is "local," indicating that it's a local volume managed by Docker on the host machine.

**Labels:** Labels are key-value pairs associated with Docker objects for categorization or metadata. In this case, no labels are assigned to the volume.

**Mountpoint:** Specifies the path on the host machine where the data for the "dibyastore" volume is stored. In this example, the mountpoint is "/var/lib/docker/volumes/dibyastore/_data."

**Name:** The name of the volume, which is "dibyastore" in this case.

**Options:** Additional options or configuration specific to the volume. In this example, no specific options are provided.

**Scope:** Indicates the scope of the volume. In this case, the scope is "local," suggesting that the volume is local to the current Docker instance or host.


### Use Volume inside the container
```
docker run -it -d --name ConA --mount source=volumedibya1,target=/apps ubuntu
docker container inspect ConA
docker run -it -d --name ConB --volume volumedibya2:/apps ubuntu
docker run -it -d --name ConC -v volumedibya2:/apps ubuntu
```

### Bind Mount
Bind mount are not managed by docker and are mapped to a host system directory.

## Docker network

Docker provides a networking feature that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Docker networking facilitates communication between containers, container orchestration, and connection to external networks. Here are some key aspects of Docker networking:

**Bridge Network:** Default network created when Docker is installed.
Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other.
Containers on different bridge networks are isolated from each other.

**Host Network:** Containers share the network namespace with the host.
Containers directly use the host's network stack, and ports are directly mapped without the need for port mapping.

**Overlay Network:** Used in Docker Swarm for communication between nodes in a swarm.
Allows containers to communicate across multiple hosts.

**Macvlan Network:** 
Assigns a MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
Containers can have their IP addresses on the same subnet as the physical network.

**None Network:** Containers do not have network access.
Useful when you want to completely isolate a container from network communication.
